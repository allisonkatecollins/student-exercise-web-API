## Starting the Student Exercises API

Your instruction team will get you started on converting your student exercises command line app into an API that will respond to HTTP requests.

### Setting up Database

1. Generate a new Web API with `dotnet new webapi -o StudentExercises`

   ```json
   {
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Warning"
       }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*",
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=StudentExercises;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     }
   }
   ```

### Exercise Model

Copy the `Models/Exercise.cs` file from the CLI application into the `Models` directory of your new API project.
